# hello-world

Hello, everyone!

My name is Diego Rodriguez and I am new to coding and GitHub. I got interested in Web Development in July 
of last year, 2018. I started with freecodecamp, went over html and css twice. I didnt think I was 
really learning it. I am now taking a course on Udemy and its making more sense; probably because
it all looks familiar.
